    Let’s say you buy 10 shares of A for $10.00 each. Then, the stock falls to $7.00 per share. You want to reduce your average cost by
    buying more shares. Let’s say you want your average to be $8.00.
  
          ($10 x 10 + n x 7)/(n + 10) = 8
  
          100 + 7n = 8n + 80
  
          n = 20
  
    This formula suggests that you should buy 20 additional shares at $7.00 per share to get average of $8.00.
